Reflections on Accessibility
============================

Things (in general that made websites more accessible)
- keyboard shortcuts
    - could be complex, and have a high bar (tech savviness, etc)
- captioning
    - auto-generated can be very inaccurate
- accessing buttons and links via the keyboard
- reformatting for videos to be larger (youtube)
- reformatting so that fonts and text is larger
    - can also make it harder to navigate b/c of formatting
- color schemes changing
- using tooltips and labels

What would our CS curriculum look like if considerations of accessibility were given higher standing?
- instead of just one class (e.g. HCI); incorporate into every required class
- instead of a unit, have it integrated into all of the (relevant) projects
    - looking at different strategies
- look at the front end projects in particular (concentrate on 3308?)
    - add a week in to 3308
- any projects that involve GUIs
    - but time is time - maybe don't require full implementation
