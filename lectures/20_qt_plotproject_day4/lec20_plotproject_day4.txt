On Tuesday, we worked on deleting Points, which required using both default slots/signals and custom slots/signals. The completed code can be found in the github from that day.


The task for today will be detecting modified clicks (like when the user is pressing "shift" when they click or if they are right-clicking).



Task 0: Make sure you have the code from last class
---------------------------------------------

If you did not finish the Tasks from last class or you were not here, download the completed zip file.


Task 1: Detecting a shift-click on a Point, updating the GUI with coordinates
-----------------------------------------------
1) In the mousePressEvent in Point, add a conditional that prints a debug statement when the user shift-clicks a point. You can access the modifiers of the event that triggered this slot by using event->modifiers() method. To see if a certain modifier was used, you can test if the flags return == Qt::ModifierYouAreLookingFor.

You may find looking at https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qt.html#KeyboardModifier-enum useful.

Take a look at the documentation for the modifiers() method--what is one way that you can break it?



2) Create a new signal in Point that carries a Point * as a parameter. Emit this signal when a Point is shift-clicked. Hook this signal up to a new slot in PlotWindow. Use debug statements to verify that they are connected for all Points that are created.


3) Use the slot in PlotWindow that you created for #2 to update the text for point1Label. Here's some code to help you out with dealing with the QString:

std::string p1 = "Point 1: (" + std::to_string(p->get_x()) + ", " + std::to_string(p->get_y()) + ")";
QString s(p1.c_str());


4) What happens to your GUI if you shift-click one Point? What happens if you shift-click a second Point?


5) Modify your PlotWindow so that when a Point is shift-clicked, you store that Point somewhere. Use debug statements to verify that you have successfully done this. Why will this be important for calculating the distance between two points?


(DO THIS INDIVIDUALLY) Task 2: Get started on PE 10--finishing the plot project! (DO THIS INDIVIDUALLY)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Take the code that you have so far and finish up the project, as described in PE 10. Do not work with a partner.
