C++ and object-oriented review
==============================

Some brief descriptions of things that you should understand and know how to do at this point in the course.

Classes
-------
1. Know how to instantiate a class, both as a pointer and not.
2. Know how to call methods of a class, both if the variable that is storing your instance is a pointer and if not.
3. Know how to define a class.
4. Know how to define constructors and methods.
5. Know how to use initialization lists.
6. Know how to declare fields.
7. Know how public/private restrict access to different parts of a class.
8. Know whether objects are pass-by-value or pass-by-reference by default.


Structs
-------
1. Know how to instantiate a struct.
2. Know how to define a struct.
3. Know whether structs are pass-by-value or pass-by-reference by default.

Pointers
--------
1. Know how to declare a pointer.
2. Know how to dereference a pointer.
3. Be comfortable using pointers as parameters.

References
----------
1. Know how to declare a reference.
2. Be comfortable using references as parameters.
3. Know how using references affects pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference.


Scope
-----
1. Know where you can access which variables.
2. Know what types are pass-by-value vs. pass-by-reference and how to test this.

Header Files
------------
1. Know how to write a header file.
2. Know how (and why) to include a header guard.

Makefiles
---------
1. Know how to write a Makefile.
2. Know how to compile your code via a Makefile from the command line.
3. Know why Makefiles are useful.

Privacy
-------
1. Know the differences between public and private.
2. Know what the friend keyword does to functions.

Overloading and overriding
--------------------------
1. Know how to override operators like == and <<
2. Know how to overload a function and why having multiple versions of the same function might be useful.

const
-----
1. Know how const affects things (in general).
2. Know how const affects parameters and methods specifically.
3. Know why const reference parameters are useful.

constructors
-----------
1. Know what a constructor is.
2. Know about the default constructor (when do you get access to it, what does it do).

enums
-----
1. Know what an enum is.
2. Know a few examples of where enums are useful.
