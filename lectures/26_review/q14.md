14. branches

Suppose that you have a repository in the following state:

```
                        HEAD
                        |
                        v
                       master
                        |
                        v
commit1 <- commit2 <- commit3
```

What is the state after the following commands are issued?
```
git checkout branch-o-saur
```

```
echo "yeah! dinosaurs!" > dinos.txt
git add .
git commit -m "added dino text file"
```

What happens when you then merge the branch `branch-o-saur` into `master`?
