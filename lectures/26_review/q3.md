3. Class attributes/fields

Given the following definitions:
```c++
struct Point {
    int x;
    int y;
};

class Shape {
public:
    double get_area();

private:
    std::vector<Point> coords_;
};
```

What constructor does `Shape` currently have? What does it do?  
  
Answer:  
It currently has the default, 0-argument constructor. Since the field is not a primitive type, it won't be initialized to anything (including an empty vector).
