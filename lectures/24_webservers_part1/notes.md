Questions on PE 11/PE 12?
------------------------

Webservices!
==============

APIs - what are they?
----------
Application Programming Interface
- clearly defined set of methods for communication amongst various components

c++ vectors - as providing an API
- push_back(element)
- erase()
- size()
- pop()

Web-dev: APIs are going to consistent of a series of endpoints - urls, that we submit requests to, in order to get information or cause state change


REST (ful) API (web dev)
-----------------------
- 4 main requests that clients can issue
    - GET - retreive some information -- idempotent
    - POST - used to create resources
    - PUT - create or update -- idempotent
    - DELETE - remove -- idempotent

- all our requests should be "stateless" - each request contains all the information needed to execute that request fully - performance, reliability, consistency across APIs

Server/Client software model
----------------------------
server - a computer program that provides functionality to other programs
    - accepts requests from certain ports from clients


client - a computer program that accesses the services provided by the server
