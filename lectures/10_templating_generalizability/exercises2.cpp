    // 8) compile this file to object code (g++ -std=c++11 -Wall exercises2.cpp -o exercises2.o),

    // 11) Experiment to find calls to this function that you would like to work but that do
    // not yet work. for each function call that doesn't work, comment about what type of 
    // error is produced.

    // 12) Create a struct that has an int field. Instantiate a vector of these structs.
    // Instantiate another instance of this struct.
    
    // 13) Call AddToValues2 w/ the vector of structs and single struct from #12

    // 14) If there was an error, attempt to fix it.
