Terminal-based Text Editors
===========================

Options
--------
1. nano/pico
2. vim
3. emacs
(Nano and pico are the least powerful of these but have the fewest "mystery commands"â€”a.k.a it isn't opaque how you edit/save, etc)

Why do we care about being able to use one?
--------------------------------------------
1. Interact with servers, any computers where we don't have GUI (graphical user interface) access.
2. Lots of hotkeys and plugins (vim & emacs).
3. Installed by default on most unix machines.
4. "Easier" to edit certain types of file "in situ" (e.g. .bashrc).

Why don't we care about being able to use one?
--------------------------------------------
1. We (almost) always have access to full-blown IDEs, which have better predicitive typing and auto-complete features, as well as better "jump to" controls (e.g. see all the places that this function is being used).

Moral of the Story
------------------
Yes, you should be comfortable with at least one (recommended: either vim or emacs). Yes, it will be a painful learning curve. Yes, it will be __immensely__ helpful!
