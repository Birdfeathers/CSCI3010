------------------------------
For all of the following questions, copy and paste the terminal commands that you use to acheive them into this file.

For example:
0. See where you are in your terminal.
pwd

1. Create a directory called "lec5_directory".

2. Change directories into lec5_directory.

3. Create a file called "names.txt".

4. Use `echo` and `>` and/or `>>` to write the names of you and your partner into the file names.txt.

5. Create a copy of "names.txt" called "names2.txt".

6. Create a directory called lec5_subdirectory and create a directory within lec5_subdirectory called subsubbasement.

7. Move to your subsubbasement directory.

8. Find your full path.

9. Without changing directories, move names2.txt to the subsubbasement directory.

10. Move back to your lec5_directory.

11. Create a directory called thisissilly

12. Using the `rm` command, remove the thisissilly directory

13. Run the following code (this question does not require an answer of any kind):
for i in `seq 1 30`; do
    touch "$i.silly"
done;

14. List all files in your directory ending in .silly. Use a "*" wildcard with `ls`.

15. Close this file (Really! close your lec5_exercises.txt file!), then move it into your lec5_directory using the `mv` command, then re-open this file.

16. Change directories to the parent directory of lec5_directory.

17. !DANGER! Careful not to destroy your work at this step !DANGER!
Make a copy of lec5_excerices.txt from the directory it is currently in to the directory that your terminal is currently in. Then remove that copy.

18. What command can you use to zip up your lec5_directory and all files and subdirectories to produce lec5.zip?

-- If you finish early --
0. What command can you use to see the contents of lec5.zip?

1. List all files in your thisissilly directory between 10.silly and 19.silly (inclusive). Use `ls` with a "?" wildcard (matches 1 single character).

2. Use the `less` command and the `cat` command on this file. What are the differences?

3. Use the `head` and `tail` commands on this file. What are the differences? What does the -n flag do?

4. How do you search for a word in the man pages?
