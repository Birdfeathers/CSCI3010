Create an introductory GUIs/Qt lesson plan targeted at a student who is currently taking CSCI 2270. Include the following:
- Use a small example that will illustrate what you describe (describe/draw what this is, you don't need to implement it)
- Include at least 2 conceptual ideas that the student needs to understand
    - I highly recommend that signals/slots is one of these ideas
- Include at least 2 coding specific things that they will need to understand, based on the concepts that you are teaching them

When you have finished, let Felix know and work on PE 12 or preparing for your technical interview for PE 11.
