Complete this worksheet with a partner.


1) Compare and contrast templated functions vs. overloaded functions (functions that have the same name but different parameters). Make sure to address both behavior and the functions that are present in the generated object code.














2) Compare and contrast templated classes vs. overridden functions (functions that have the same signature as in the base class and have been re-implemented in subclasses). Be sure to give examples that demonstrate what you have described.
























3) Compare and contrast explicit template specialization vs. overloaded functions. Explicit template specialization is when you have a templated function and implement a version for a specific type, for instance:

template<typename T>
T add(T v1, T v2) {
	return v1 + v2;
}

template<>
bool add(bool v1, bool v2) {
	return v1 || v2;
}
