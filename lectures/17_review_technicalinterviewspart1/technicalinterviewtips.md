Technical Interviews Tips
----------

1. talk through your code as you are doing it (practice this!)
2. talk through your code as you are writing it on a white board or a computer (ask where you will be coding for the technical portion!)
3. use a language that you are comfortable with (don't use a language you are uncomfortable with just to try to impress a reviewer)
4. start with the simple solution that you can think of
    1. if you discard an approach, make sure to explain why
    2. take the hints from the interviewer - if they make a suggestion of ask a question, give it due consideration
    3. ask clarifying questions
    4. think about edge cases-after writing your code, walk through it with an example (or two, if it's relatively simple)
5. then move on to a more efficient/more complex solution once you have something that is working
6. know what algorithms that have runtimes of n, n^2, n^n, log(n), n! look like in general
7. make sure you've done your research on the company and have some questions prepared to ask the interviewer
