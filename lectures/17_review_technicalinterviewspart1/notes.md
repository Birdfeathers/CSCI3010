- if you discard an approach, explain why
- if your interviewer gives you hints, consider them appropriately- ask clarifying questions to know exactly what you're doing
- once you're done, walk through your code with some examples (and some edge cases)
- now, move on to more efficent/better solutions

4) know, in general, what algorithms with runtimes of n, n^2, nlog(n), n!, n^n

5) research the company beforehand, have some questions prepared
