Technical Interviews
tips:

‪1a) talk through your code as you are doing it‬ (practice this!)

‪1b) talk through your code as you are writing it on a white board or a computer (ask where you will be coding for the technical portion!)‬

1c) use a language that you are comfortable with (don't use a language you are uncomfortable with just to try to impress a reviewer)



‪2) start with the simple solution that you can think of‬


2b) if you discard an approach, make sure to explain why


2c) take the hints from the interviewer - if they make a suggestion of ask a question, give it due consideration


2d) ask clarifying questions


2e) think about edge cases-after writing your code, walk through it with an example (or two, if it's relatively simple)




‪3) then move on to a more efficient/more complex solution once you have something that is working‬



4) know what algorithms that have runtimes of n, n^2, n^n, log(n), n! look like in general



5) make sure you've done your research on the company and have some questions prepared to ask the interviewer
