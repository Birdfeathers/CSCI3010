Recommended workflow:
---------------
1. Clone this repository (`git clone https://github.com/muzny/csci3010-cuboulder.git`)
2. Do a `git pull` at the beginning of classes when we are using 
3. If you edit or change a file, make a copy of that file and work on the copy so that any updates we make in the future don't create merge conflicts OR practice dealing with merge conflicts.
