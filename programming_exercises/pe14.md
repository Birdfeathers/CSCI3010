PE 14 (add features to our proto-messenger) (20 points)
==============


Add the following features to the messenger web server from lecture 25:
1. When you do a GET request from the `/chatrooms` url, each room should be a link to that room's contents. Example: a room called "llamas" should be a link to `/chatrooms?room=llamas`.
2. Add a new POST request endpoint at `/announce` that takes a JSON message in the same format as the `/message` endpoint, but posts the message to __all__ chatrooms. The JSON object doesn't need a "room" field for this reason. The message should be posted to the chatrooms labelled "ANNOUNCEMENT: " then the announcement.

You may find that you need to upgrade both `boost` and `cmake` if you have these previously installed.
