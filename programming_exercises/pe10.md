PE 10 (refactoring)
==============

__Note!__ This programming exercise is due Friday, October 26th at 5pm.

In this exercise you will take code that could be significantly improved and [refactor it according to the guidelines from lecture 17](../lectures/17_coding_qt_deletepoints/codingpractices.md).

For this exercise, you have two options:

1. If you did the election simulation homework __AND__ your code could be significantly improved through refactoring (there are at least 5 places that you will be refactoring):
- Refactor your election simulator code, following the above guidelines.
- When we grade the style and structure of your homework submission, we will take into account the work that you have done in this exercise. (This __does mean__ that you have the potential to get back some points in HW 3 that you would have lost.)
- __To turn in__:
    - Your refactored code. Be sure to mark everywhere you have made changes with the comment "PE 10 REFACTORED".
    - Name this file: hw3_refactored.zip

2. Refactor the [provided code](pe10_code/) in this directory following the above guidelines.
- __To turn in__:
    - Name this file: pe10.zip
