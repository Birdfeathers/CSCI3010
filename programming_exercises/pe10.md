PE 10 (HW 4 Design Document)
===========================

If you are completing the individual project, see instructions below.  

1. Read [the homework 4 description](../homework/hw4_life/).
2. You (and your partner) will make a plan of which objects are in charge of what, how they will communicate (what methods they will have, what signals will they emit, what slots will they have), and what data they will control (what fields will they have). You should also indicate what signals will be emitted by UI elements and which objects will respond to these signals.
    1. Take a look at [the example PE 7 diagram on canvas](https://canvas.colorado.edu/courses/51530/files/9541530?module_item_id=1611027)
    2. Use the plot project that we'll be working on in class from Lecture 19 - Lecture 20 as well as the Qt documentation to help guide your design.
    3. Your design document does not need to be a 100% final plan, but should account for all features that you plan on having.
3. Fill out the Homework 4 Features [google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfEgfDUiwjUG8H1s4n1Cq_l9QzayMZgx-JN9VeglvHQbCYHsA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

Individual Projects
-------------------
If you are completing an individual project, you have the option of either completing steps 1 & 2 for the "standard PE 10" (above or creating a user testing plan for your project.

Create a table with five tasks that a user should be able to complete with your project when it is finished. For each task, complete the following:
- what is the task?
- currently completable with your software so far?
- tester 1 observations
- tester 2 observations

Your table should be similar to [the one that we completed during lecture 18](../lectures/18_lowfiprototyping_guis/). At least two of the tasks must be ones that a person could currently complete. If you do not have two tasks that a user could currently complete, do the "standard track" PE 10.

Next, fill out the cells in the table corresponding to tester 1 & 2 feedback for (at minimum) your 2 currently completeable tasks.

Finally, answer the following questions:
1. Will you be changing your design at all based on the feedback that you received? If yes, how so? If no, why not?
2. Which task do you believe will be most difficult for new users of your application to complete? Why? What could you change about your design to make this task less difficult?
