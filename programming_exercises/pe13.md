PE 12 (add features to our proto-messenger, map/reduce/filter exercises)
==============


1. Add the following features to the [messenger web server from lecture 19](../lectures/19/webservices_part2):
- When you do a GET request from the `/chatrooms` url, each room should be a link to that room's contents. Example: a room called "llamas" should be a link to `/chatrooms?room=llamas`.
- Add a new POST request endpoint at `/announce` that takes a JSON message in the same format as the `/message` endpoint, but posts the message to __all__ chatrooms. The JSON object doesn't need a "room" field for this reason. The message should be posted to the chatrooms labelled "ANNOUNCEMENT: " then the announcement.

2. Use map/reduce/filter to solve the following problems. Remember to include the line `from functools import reduce` to access the reduce function in python.
- Given a list of numbers and a number, find all multiples of the given number.
- Given a list of elements, find the maximum element without using the max function.
- Given a list of strings, create one string that is the concatenation of all unique characters in the strings, case insensitive. You cannot use sets to solve this problem.
