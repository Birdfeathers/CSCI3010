PE 11 (technical interview) (15 points)
==============
Complete a mini-technical interview with Nikhil or Jay during the week of 11/12 - 11/19. The appointments will be posted on canvas on 11/11. You may only do __one__ technical interview.  

If you cancel your appointment within 12 hours of your slot, this will be considered a no-show. If an emergency occurs and you are unable to attend, get in contact with Jay, Nikhil, and Felix ASAP. (Jay.Patel@colorado.edu, nikhil.jain@colorado.edu, muzny@colorado.edu)

Here is non-exhaustive a list of topics to review!
- linked lists (implementation & manipulation)
- stacks, maps, queues (when and how to use them)
- string manipulation
- working with 2d arrays/vectors
- recursion
- traversing data structures such as binary trees
- recognizing the complexity of your solutions

Note! Many of your points will be assigned based on how effectively you communicate and describe your algorithm, not on whether or not your answer is perfect!  
  
You will be graded on the following categories:
1. Uses an appropriate programming language correctly
2. Explains what you are doing clearly
3. Correctly identifies the time complexity of your solution
4. Implements a mostly correct solution
5. Implements a completely correct solution
