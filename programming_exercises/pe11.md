PE 11 (templating and writing generalizable code in c++)
==============

For this exercise, you'll be continuing to explore [templating in c++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_(C%2B%2B)).

Define a templated class `TwoDimensionalVector` that can hold elements of any type. Your class should have the following methods:
1. a constructor that takes two integers, `rows` and `columns`.
1. a constructor that takes two integers, `rows` and `columns` and one value of type `T` to set all values in the 2D vector to initially.
2. `T get_value(int row, int column)` that returns the value at the given location in the vector.
3. `void set_value(int row, int column, T value)` that sets the value at the given location to the given value.
4. `void AddToValues(T value)` that adds `value` to each element in the 2D vector.
5. overload the `<<` operator.

Write adequate code in your `main.cpp` to test your `TwoDimensionalVector`. You must have instantiated at least 3 `TwoDimensionalVector`s of different sizes and types and called all methods.  
  
__Hints__:
1. Creating dynamically sized `std::vector<std::vector<T> >` in C++ can be difficult.
2. You need to create an interface that seems like the user is interacting with a 2D vector, but the underlying implementation does not need to be a nested vector.

__Clarifications__:
1. Your `TwoDimensionalVector` will always be rectangular (all rows have the same number of columns).
2. Your `TwoDimensionalVector` doesn't need to be able to be resized after initially created.
